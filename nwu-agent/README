= NWU Agent =
=============

NWU agent is the software installed in the computers one wants to
manage.

nwu-server first!
-----------------
First you have to setup nwu-server in a server for your network. See the README
for nwu-server if you skipped that step, then come back reading this file.


Special package requirement: python-sysinfo
-------------------------------------------

Besides packages available in both debian/etch and ubuntu/edgy, 
nwu-agent also requires python-sysinfo, which I wrote as part of my other
project, PyCACIC. python-sysinfo is a library for system information
collection. It is now integrated into the NWU trunk.

Currently, NWU doesn't not get many data from the computer the agent is 
installed in, but extensive collection of hardware, network and services
info is planned. That would be an interesting side-effect feature of NWU.

Installation
------------

You should use the provided deb packages.

#FIXME: download them from..

Usage info
-----------

When you install the package, a debconf dialog will ask the nwu server host and
port address. That's all you have to configure. Notice that this name must 
match the common name of the certificate used by the NWU server, or it will
fail.

The package will install a cron script in /etc/cron.d/nwu-agent, which
will run the nwu-agent and nwu-maint scripts from time to time. It is planned
to make a clever daemon that will wake up and run these scripts in a more
clever way. See bug #20 in the trac system of the project for updates.

nwu-agent must run by an unprivileged user, usually nwu-agent, and will 
connect to the server to send updated data and get pending tasks, like 
"updates" or "installs". You can force the execution of this script
by using sudo:

# sudo -u nwuagent nwu-agent

If any pending task is found, nwu-agent stores them in 
/var/spool/nwu/nw.tasks.

nwu-maint is called regularly by cron and will read this file and resolve
the pending tasks.

Both scripts logs actions to syslog. If a nwu-maint task (eg. install) 
fails, a mail will be sent to the local root account with details.
