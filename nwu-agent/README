= NWU Agent =
=============

NWU agent is the software installed in the computers one wants to
manage.

Nwu-server first!
-----------------
First you have to setup nwu-server in a server for your network. See the README
for nwu-server if you skipped that step, then come back reading this file.

Special package requirement: python-sysinfo
-------------------------------------------

Besides packages available in both debian/etch and ubuntu/breezy, 
nwu-agent also requires python-sysinfo, which I wrote as part of my other
project, PyCACIC. python-sysinfo is a library for system information
collection. 

Currently, nwu doesn't not get many data from the computer the agent is 
installed in, but extensive info for hardware, network and services
is planned. That would be an interesting side-effect feature of nwu.

It is not available in Debian or Ubuntu repositories yet. Download it
from:

http://archives.ubuntubrasil.org/pool/main/p/python-sysinfo/

Or use this line in your sources.list and install it using aptitude:

deb http://archives.ubuntubrasil.org/ breezy main

Installation
------------

The only supported installation method ATM is to use the provided
deb packages.

Download the deb package from the opensvn repository in:

https://dev.ubuntubrasil.org/trac/nwu/browser/tags/

dpkg -i nwu-agent_0.1.3-1_all.deb

It may complain about missing packages. Just install them using aptitude.

Usage info
-----------

When you install the package, a debconf dialog will ask the server host and
port addresses. That's all you have to configure.

The package will install a cron script in /etc/cron.d/nwu-agent, which
will run the nwu-agent and nwu-maint scripts.

The first is run by an unprivileged user and will connect to the server to
send updated data and get pending tasks, like "updates" or "installs".

If any pending task is found, nwu-agent stores them in 
/var/spool/nwu/nw.tasks.

The second script called regularly by cron will read this file and resolve
the pending tasks.

Both scripts logs the actions to syslog.
