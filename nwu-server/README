NWU

Network wide updates for systems which use APT.

About:

Nwu is a network-wide update system for systems which use APT for 
software installation and upgrades. 

It allows an administrator to maintain all relevant network nodes 
from one central point, using a simple CLI tool. He or she can 
install packages in the remote nodes, list pending updates, 
roll security upgrades, and update the remote machine's APT package 
cache.

It's pretty simple to install and use.

For more information, please see the project site at:

Installation and Usage:

Nwu has two compontents: nwu-server and nwu-client

You install Nwu-server in one server, and Nwu-client on all nodes. Then
you would use the "nwu" command in the server to keep them up to date,
and to install new software.

a) Nwu-server installation:

Install the nwu-server*.deb package:

# dpkg -i nwu-server_*.deb

It could complain about missing dependencies, so install them using
apt-get.

If the installation is sucessful, a few debconf questions will appear
for creating the SSL certificate. It's really important that you
specify a valid "commonName" for this server (usually, its FQDN), 
because a client must use that host to connect to this server.

After that, it will create a database automatically, and start.

b) Nwu-client installation:

This is pretty simple. Install both the python-sysinfo package
that you downloaded, and the nwu-client package, plus any 
required dependency. A debconf dialog will ask for the server 
address. The default port is 8088, and

**you must use the commonName is specified above, here**

So, if you created a SSL certificate with a commonName of: "myserver.mydomain.tld",
you will probably enter "myserver.mydomain.tld:8088" here.


Extra options:

You can change the port used by the server and other settings (like maybe
using a PostgreSQL database instead) by updating /etc/nwu/server.conf. It's
pretty simple, you won't have any problems there, I believe.

Nwu admin CLI tool:

Usually you would use the "nwu" command as root to manage your clients.

Actually, if that doesn't look good to you, the admin could be any member of the
nwuserver group, so he/she can read /etc/nwu/server.conf and use that 
information to connect to the database.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If nwu-server is behaving strangely, you can use the "-e" parameter to
redirect python errors what would be sent to /dev/null to a log file,
and then see what's happening. I hope this ugly feature will not be necessary
in later versions of NWU, and all logs would be sent either to syslog OR
to stdout. (Most are already)
