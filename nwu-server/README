Nwu-server installation
-----------------------

--- DATABASE ---
In order to use nwu-server you need a database backend compatible with python
sqlobject (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

SQLite is nice and simple, but I've done tests with nwu and sqlite did not have
very good speed ratings, as expected from this kind of database. It's a very 
good option for testing and for networks with just a few nodes. Other than 
that, either PostgreSQL and MySQL are good options.

A) - MySQL -

Create database:

CREATE DATABASE nwu;

Create user:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nwu.* TO 'nwu'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURPASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Create tables:

Don't worry. In the current version, nwu will try to create the tables in every run.

B) - SQLite - 

Leave everything to nwu-server and it will create the database file in /var/lib/nwu/nwu.db, with all required tables.

C) - PostgreSQL -

Not yet tested, sorry.


--- Nwu-server config file ---

You have to configure nwu-server parameters in the /etc/nwu/server.conf file.
This file must only be readable by the nwuserver user, since it has sensitive
information like database user and password.

The webservice section defines in what address and port nwu-server will listen 
for connections from the clients.

In the database section you'll define database settings, but that is pretty
straightforward, as you can see in this sample config file.

Sample config file:

-----------------------
[webservice]

# The host your clients will connect to.
host = nictuku.dyndns.org
port = 8088

[database]
type = sqlite
host =
database = /var/lib/nwu/nwu.db
user =
password =

#type = mysql
#host = localhost
#database = nwu
#user = nwu
#password = PASSHERE
------------------------


--- Nwu admin CLI tool ---

In order to manage nwu, in the current version, the admin must be a member
of the nwuserver group, so he/she can read /etc/nwu/server.conf and use
that information to connect to the database.

adduser <adminuser> nwuserver

In later versions all management activities will use XML-RPC calls, so one
will be able to use nwu admin tools (both CLI and PyGTK) from a remote machine.
